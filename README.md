This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Using ReactJS and Bootstrap, I am going to redesign and build a more interactive and entertaining website for TAA-NJ.

Status:
  1. React-router supports page navigation, which allows users to navigate pages between Home, Photos, About and Links.
  2. React-bootstrap facilitates styling TAA-NJ website.
  3. React-slick enables image carousel component that showcases TAA-NJ's aims.
  4. Adds hamburger button in Header.js to meet different screen size (completed)

Future:
  1. Add contact page for sending email to TAA-NJ
