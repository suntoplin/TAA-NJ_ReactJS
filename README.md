This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Using ReactJS and Bootstrap, I am going to redesign and build a more interactive and entertaining website for TAA-NJ.

Status:
  1. React-router supports pagination, which allows users to navigate pages between Home, Photos, About and Links.
  2. React-bootstrap facilitates styling TAA-NJ website.

Future:
  1. In Home page, add upcoming events.
  2. In Photo page, add image popup box feature for aging adults.
  3. Complete About and Links pages.
